# Python-Mortgage

### Why I started this?
  
  On November I decided to switch banks because they were offering free withdrawals accross the world.
  Soon after I got bombarded by calls and messages asking for a meetup to propose a so-called "tailored" investment plan.
  
  The investment plan consisted in several BUZZWORDS , omitted the drawbacks of any investment, and failed to provide insights on investment break-even point, commisions, funds past overlook...
  
#### Past rentabilities don't assure the future, remember!
  
  The bank wanted me to sign the investment plan right away. When I refused and told them I would do a program to visualize and project the data they had gave to me, the answer was 
  
  > Why are you wasting your time on this? Do you want to refute us when you have no economics knowledge? Do you refute your doctor?

So then the project was born. Well, i lied, it was TWO projects, because as Team Rocket said, make it double:

- **Python-mortgage** ( This one ) . Easy yaml-based input calculator for investing in real-estate. Simply configurable. Doesn't support overlapping mortgages, though it could be implemented. I skipped this since I don't recommend being that tied to the banks, but up to you folks! I go each year to Japan, so I thought getting some real estate both in Spain and Japan would be an awesome idea! 
- **Investment-Forecaster** : Second project which will consist on a yaml-configurable investment forecaster, modular ( you can select which bank products you activate ). Probably will use bs4 to get past fund data.

# TL;DR . How do I run this?

  - Install the requirements
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
 - Fill in the inputs.yml to your likings..
 - Fire it up! If you want to read from a different file not named inputs.yml , append it to the call
 ```
 python mortgage.py <filename>
 ```
